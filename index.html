    <h3>Pokemon Prediction:</h3>
    <p>This Project is and Dogs Deep Learning Algorithm, which receives input as
      image and assign weights to that image . In this Project, I have finished the
      prediction between two classes of images(Ex: Cats and Dogs).</p><br>

    <h3>Voice Control Bot:</h3>
    <p>There have been many car accidents due to sleepiness or not being able to
      drive properly at night. Till date there have been many advancements in the
      industry of Internet of Things, for example being able to control lights from
      anywhere in the world using voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.
      Here the proposed system extends the application of Internet of Things in the
      aforementioned problem. So, the prototype can be controlled using an
      individualâ€™s voice and can also be stopped after it has travelled some distance
      for safety reasons.</p>
